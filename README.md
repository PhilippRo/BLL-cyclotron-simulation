BLL: Simulation of a Cyclotron
==================

This a school project I did. It simulates the fastest particles in 
cyclotrons with different configurations and provides a cheap and save
comparison of different cyclotron configurations.

I apologize the German language of the paper, presentation, documentation 
and comments, but I was forced to use the national language in this school
project.
